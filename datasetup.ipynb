Using an empty string as the user password doesn't work, but it seems (section 3.5.2 of the spec) that there has to be a user password to create the hash for the admin password.\\n\\nWhat I would like is either an explanation of how to do this, or any code that I can read (ideally Python, C, or C++, but anything readable will do) that does this so that I can understand what I'm meant to be doing.

       " \"Recently I've been experimenting with TDD while developing a GUI application in Python. I find it very reassuring to have tests that verify the functionality of my code, but it's been tricky to follow some of the recommened practices of TDD. Namely, writing tests first has been hard. And I'm finding it difficult to make my tests readable (due to extensive use of a mocking library).\\n\\nI chose a mocking library called <a href=http://labix.org/mocker rel=nofollow>mocker</a>. I use it a lot since much of the code I'm testing makes calls to (a) other methods in my application that depend on system state or (b) ObjC/Cocoa objects that cannot exist without an event loop, etc.\\n\\nAnyway, I've got a lot of tests that look like this:\\n\\n<pre><code>def test_current_window_controller():\\n    def test(config):\\n        ac = AppController()\\n        m = Mocker()\\n        ac.iter_window_controllers = iwc = m.replace(ac.iter_window_controllers)\\n        expect(iwc()).result(iter(config))\\n        with m:\\n            result = ac.current_window_controller()\\n            assert result == (config[0] if config else None)\\n    yield test, []\\n    yield test, [0]\\n    yield test, [1, 0]\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nNotice that this is actually three tests; all use the same parameterized test function. Here's the code that is being tested:\\n\\n<pre><code>def current_window_controller(self):\\n    try:\\n        # iter_window_controllers() iterates in z-order starting\\n        # with the controller of the top-most window\\n        # assumption: the top-most window is the current one\\n        wc = self.iter_window_controllers().next()\\n    except StopIteration:\\n        return None\\n    return wc\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nOne of the things I've noticed with using mocker is that it's easier to write the application code first and then go back and write the tests second, since most of the time I'm mocking many method calls and the syntax to write the mocked calls is much more verbose (thus harder to write) than the application code. It's easier to write the app code and then model the test code off of that.\\n\\nI find that with this testing method (and a bit of discipline) I can easily write code with 100% test coverage.\\n\\nI'm wondering if these tests are good tests? Will I regret doing it this way down the road when I finally discover the secret to writing good tests?\\n\\nAm I violating the core principles of TDD so much that my testing is in vain?\\n\",\n",

The big missing features are proper dispatching and templating with inheritance, amongst others.\\n\\nCurrently there are two paths being discussed:\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Port the existing application to Classic ASP using JScript, which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .NET MSJscript without too much trouble, and eventually end up on the .NET platform (preferably the MVC stuff will be done by then, ASP.NET isn't much better than were we are on now, in our opinions). This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.</li>\\n<li>Completely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other pre-built solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we can't/don't get it right.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\nThis does not mean that our logic is gone, as what we have built over the years is fairly stable, as noted just difficult to deal with. It is built on SQL Server 2005 with heavy use of stored procedures and published on IIS 6, just for a little more background.\\n\\nNow, the question. Has anyone taken either of the two paths above? If so, was it successful, how could it have been better, etc. We aren't looking to deviate much from doing one of those two things, but some suggestions or other solutions would potentially be helpful.\\n\",\n",

It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:\\n\\n<pre><code>#in Tool\\ndef render(self, screen):\\n    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)\\n\\n#in Scroll\\ndef render(self, screen, image, odePos):\\n    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)\\n    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious\\n\\ndef odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):\\n    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset\\n    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)\\n\\ndef odeToPixels(odeUnits):\\n    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nWhew, that was a long explanation.

Some transitions have a condition, which must be fulfilled in order to traverse this condition, if there is no condition, the transition is basically an epsilon-transition in an NFA and will be traversed without consuming an input symbol.\\n\\nI need the following operations:  \\n\\n\\n<li>check if the transition has a label</li>\\n<li>get this label</li>\\n<li>add a label to a transition</li>\\n<li>check if the transition has a condition </li>\\n<li>get this condition</li>\\n<li>check for equality</li>\\n\\n\\nJudging from the first five points, this sounds like a clear decorator, with a base transition and two decorators: Labeled and Condition.

With a decorator, I might have two transitions Labeled(foo, Conditional(bar, Transition(baz, qux))) and Conditional(bar, Labeled(foo, Transition(baz, qux))) which need a non-local equality, that is, the decorators would need to collect all the data and the Transition must compare this collected data on a set-base:\\n\\n<pre><code>class Transition(object):\\n    def __init__(self, start, end):\\n        self.start = start\\n        self.end = end\\n    def get_label(self):\\n        return None\\n    def has_label(self):\\n        return False\\n    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):\\n        return decorations\\n    def internal_equality(self, my_decorations, other):\\n        try:\\n            return (self.start == other.start\\n                    and self.end == other.end\\n                    and my_decorations = other.collect_decorations())\\n    def __eq__(self, other):\\n        return self.internal_equality(self.collect_decorations({}), other)\\n\\nclass Labeled(object):\\n    def __init__(self, label, base):\\n        self.base = base\\n        self.label = label\\n    def has_label(self):\\n        return True\\n    def get_label(self):\\n        return self.label\\n    def collect_decorations(self, decorations):\\n        assert 'label' not in decorations\\n        decorations['label'] = self.label\\n        return self.base.collect_decorations(decorations)\\n    def __getattr__(self, attribute):\\n        return self.base.__getattr(attribute)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nIs this a clean approach?

Unfortunately I don't know if that will happen at this time. \\n\\nRight now I am looking into storing this data in a structure that is not based on a hash-table (ie. a dictionary). I would like the new structure to be fairly quick on insertion, but reading it can be linear since I only really do it twice. I am trying to move away from the hash table to save space.

So far, all well and dandy.\\n\\nWe've been i14ing (heh) our product, and one thing we'd like to do is format user-facing numerical output according to the user's locale settings.

However, if the user's locale differs from the default C locale, any files that are subsequently loaded will return incorrect data, presumably because all string-to-float conversion has been affected, right down to the metal.\\n\\nWe can't work around this by implementing locale aware file loading, so our current workaround is to only set the locale when formatting output for the user, and then set it back again afterwards.

For example, it might convert all arguments to a specific type, perform logging, implement memoization, etc.\\n\\nHere is an example:\\n\\n<pre><code>def args_as_ints(f):\\n    def g(*args, **kwargs):\\n        args = [int(x) for x in args]\\n        kwargs = dict((k, int(v)) for k, v in kwargs.items())\\n        return f(*args, **kwargs)\\n    return g\\n\\n@args_as_ints\\ndef funny_function(x, y, z=3):\\n    Computes x*y + 2*z\\n    return x*y + 2*z\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; funny_function(3, 4.0, z=5)\\n22\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nEverything well so far. There is one problem, however. The decorated function does not retain the documentation of the original function:\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(funny_function)\\nHelp on function g in module __main__:\\n\\ng(*args, **kwargs)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nFortunately, there is a workaround:\\n\\n<pre><code>def args_as_ints(f):\\n    def g(*args, **kwargs):\\n        args = [int(x) for x in args]\\n        kwargs = dict((k, int(v)) for k, v in kwargs.items())\\n        return f(*args, **kwargs)\\n    g.__name__ = f.__name__\\n    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__\\n    return g\\n\\n@args_as_ints\\ndef funny_function(x, y, z=3):\\n    Computes x*y + 2*z\\n    return x*y + 2*z\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nThis time, the function name and documentation are correct:\\n\\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(funny_function)\\nHelp on function funny_function in module __main__:\\n\\nfunny_function(*args, **kwargs)\\n    Computes x*y + 2*z\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nBut there is still a problem: the function signature is wrong. The information *args, **kwargs is next to useless.\\n\\nWhat to do? I can think of two simple but flawed workarounds:\\n\\n1 -- Include the correct signature in the docstring:\\n\\n<pre><code>def funny_function(x, y, z=3):\\n    funny_function(x, y, z=3) -- computes x*y + 2*z\\n    return x*y + 2*z\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nThis is bad because of the duplication. The signature will still not be shown properly in automatically generated documentation. It's easy to update the function and forget about changing the docstring, or to make a typo. [<i>And yes, I'm aware of the fact that the docstring already duplicates the function body. Please ignore this; funny_function is just a random example.</i>]\\n\\n2 -- Not use a decorator, or use a special-purpose decorator for every specific signature:\\n\\n<pre><code>def funny_functions_decorator(f):\\n    def g(x, y, z=3):\\n        return f(int(x), int(y), z=int(z))\\n    g.__name__ = f.__name__\\n    g.__doc__ = f.__doc__\\n    return g\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nThis works fine for a set of functions that have identical signature, but it's useless in general. As I said in the beginning, I want to be able to use decorators entirely generically.\\n\\nI'm looking for a solution that is fully general, and automatic.\\n\\nSo the question is: is there a way to edit the decorated function signature after it has been created?\\n\\nOtherwise, can I write a decorator that extracts the function signature and uses that information instead of *kwargs, **kwargs when constructing the decorated function? How do I extract that information? How should I construct the decorated function -- with exec?\\n\\nAny other approaches?\\n\",\n",

       " \"I am a member of a team that is about to launch a beta of a python (Django specifically) based web site and accompanying suite of backend tools.  The team itself has doubled in size from 2 to 4 over the past few weeks and we expect continued growth for the next couple of months at least.  One issue that has started to plague us is getting everyone up to speed in terms of getting their development environment configured and having all the right eggs installed, etc.\\n\\nI'm looking for ways to simplify this process and make it less error prone.  Both zc.buildout and virtualenv look like they would be good tools for addressing this problem but both seem to concentrate primarily on the python-specific issues.  We have a couple of small subprojects in other languages (Java and Ruby specifically) as well as numerous python extensions that have to be compiled natively (lxml, MySQL drivers, etc).  In fact, one of the biggest thorns in our side has been getting some of these extensions compiled against appropriate versions of the shared libraries so as to avoid segfaults, malloc errors and all sorts of similar issues.  It doesn't help that out of 4 people we have 4 different development environments -- 1 leopard on ppc, 1 leopard on intel, 1 ubuntu and 1 windows.\\n\\nUltimately what would be ideal would be something that works roughly like this, from the dos/unix prompt:\\n\\n$ git clone [repository url]\\n...\\n$ python setup-env.py\\n...\\n\\nthat then does what zc.buildout/virtualenv does (copy/symlink the python interpreter, provide a clean space to install eggs) then installs all required eggs, including installing any native shared library dependencies, installs the ruby project, the java project, etc.\\n\\nObviously this would be useful for both getting development environments up as well as deploying on staging/production servers.\\n\\nIdeally I would like for the tool that accomplishes this to be written in/extensible via python, since that is (and always will be) the lingua franca of our team, but I am open to solutions in other languages.\\n\\nSo, my question then is: does anyone have any suggestions for better alternatives or any experiences they can share using one of these solutions to handle larger/broader install bases?\\n\",\n",

Given such a thing, one could easily imagine going on to check the expression's syntax with <code>compile()</code>, evaluate it against a particular scope with <code>eval()</code>, and perhaps even substitute the result into the original string.  People must do very similar things all the time.\\n\\nI could imagine solving such a problem using a third-party parser generator [oof], or by hand-coding some sort of state machine [eek], or perhaps by convincing Python's own parser to do the heavy lifting somehow [hmm].  Maybe there's a third-party templating library somewhere that can be made to do exactly this.  Maybe restricting the syntax of <em>expr</em> is likely to be a worthwhile compromise in terms of simplicity or execution time or cutting down on external dependencies -- for example, maybe all I really need is something that matches any <em>expr</em> that has balanced curly braces.\\n\\nWhat's your sense?\\n\\n<h2>Update:</h2>\\n\\nThanks very much for your responses so far!  Looking back at what I wrote yesterday, I'm not sure I was sufficiently clear about what I'm asking.  Template substitution is indeed an interesting problem, and probably much more useful to many more people than the expression extraction subproblem I'm wondering about, but I brought it up only as a simple example of how the answer to my question might be useful in real life.  Some other potential applications might include passing the extracted expressions to a syntax highlighter; passing the result to a real Python parser and looking at or monkeying with the parse tree; or using the sequence of extracted expressions to build up a larger Python program, perhaps in conjunction with some information taken from the surrounding text.\\n\\nThe <code>${</code><em>expr</em><code>}</code> syntax I mentioned is also intended as an example, and in fact I wonder if I shouldn't have used <code>$(</code><em>expr</em><code>)</code> as my example instead, because it makes the potential drawbacks of the obvious approach, along the lines of <code>re.finditer(r'$\\\\{([^}]+)\\\\}', s)</code>, a bit easier to see.  Python expressions can (and often do) contain the <code>)</code> (or <code>}</code>) character.  It seems possible that handling any of those cases might be much more trouble than it's worth, but I'm not convinced of that yet.  Please feel free to try to make this case!\\n\\nPrior to posting this question, I spent quite a bit of time looking at Python template engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality I'm asking about -- namely, something that can find expressions in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expressions embedded using a single hard-coded syntax, always evaluating them, and always substituting the results back into the original string.  I haven't figured out how to use any of them to solve my problem yet, but I do very much appreciate the suggestions regarding more to look at (can't believe I missed that wonderful list on the wiki!).  The API documentation for these things tends to be pretty high-level, and I'm not too familiar with the internals of any of them, so I'm sure I could use help looking at those and figuring out how to get them to do this sort of thing.\\n\\nThanks for your patience!\\n\",\n",

Counting down I knew that in the data rows I would need to get the values in columns [3, 7, 11, 15].  So I set out to accomplish that using this code:\\n\\n<pre><code>indexComment = souptoGetColIndex.findAll(text=re.compile(type=body))\\nindexRow=indexComment[0].findParent()\\nindexCells=indexRow.findAll(text=re.compile(type=body))\\nfor each in range(len(indexCells)):\\n    collist.append(tdlist.index(indexCells[each].previousSibling.previousSibling))\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nwhat I got back was collist=[0, 3, 7, 7, 15]\\n\\nIt turns out I think that because cells in the 7th and 11th position looked exactly alike the same index position was returned.  I was trying to figure out how to deal with this, clearly I had to make them look different.  So what I did was make them look different by first using a readlines to read each line of the file in and change the blank spaces to a random integer.\\n\\n<pre><code>for each in toGetColIndex:\\n   newlt.append(each.replace(r&amp;nbsp;,str(random.randint(1,14567))))\\n</code></pre>\\n\\na friend pointed out that I could lower overhead by using this instead\\n\\n<pre><code>for each in toGetColIndex:\\n   newlt.append(each.replace(r&amp;nbsp;,str(toGetColIndex.index(each))))\\n</code></pre>\\n\\nNonetheless, each of these approaches gets me a list with the colindex for the location of my headers for each column and to use on the data rows.  Note that replace function is missing the blank space since I guess the html is causing it to disappear the actual code uses r&amp;.n.b.s.p; without the periods\\n',\n",

       " \"I am working on a desktop application in PyGTK and seem to be bumping up against some limitations of my file organization.  Thus far I've structured my project this way:\\n\\n\\n<li>application.py - holds the primary application class (most functional routines)</li>\\n<li>gui.py - holds a loosely coupled GTK gui implementation.  Handles signal callbacks, etc.</li>\\n<li>command.py - holds command line automation functions not dependent on data in the application class</li>\\n<li>state.py - holds the state data persistence class</li>\\n\\n\\nThis has served fairly well so far, but at this point application.py is starting to get rather long.  I have looked at numerous other PyGTK applications and they seem to have similar structural issues.  At a certain point the primary module starts to get very long and there is not obvious way of breaking the code out into narrower modules without sacrificing clarity and object orientation.\\n\\nI have considered making the GUI the primary module and having seperate modules for the toolbar routines, the menus routines, etc, but at that point I believe I will lose most of the benefits of OOP and end up with an everything-references-everything scenario.\\n\\nShould I just deal with having a very long central module or is there a better way of structuring the project so that I don't have to rely on the class browser so much?\\n\\n<strong>EDIT I</strong>\\n\\nOk, so point taken regarding all the MVC stuff.  I do have a rough approximation of MVC in my code, but admittedly I could probably gain some mileage by further segregating the model and controller.  However, I am reading over python-gtkmvc's documentation (which is a great find by the way, thank you for referencing it) and my impression is that its not going to solve my problem so much as just formalize it.  My application is a single glade file, generally a single window. So no matter how tightly I define the MVC roles of the modules I'm still going to have one controller module doing most everything, which is pretty much what I have now. Admittedly I'm a little fuzzy on proper MVC implementation and I'm going to keep researching, but it doesn't look to me like this architecture is going to get any more stuff out of my main file, its just going to rename that file to controller.py.\\n\\nShould I be thinking about separate Controller/View pairs for seperate sections of the window (the toolbar, the menus, etc)?
